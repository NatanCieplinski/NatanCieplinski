### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natan and Iâ€™m a Computer Science Student and Junior Web Developer with a passion for UX.

Currently I am in the last year of my bachelor degree, and the expected graduation date is in October so exams and my thesis are my priorities. If you still want to get in touch, my DMs are open.

Tech i enjoy working with the most: 
- **JavaScript** ðŸ’› : i'm particular fascinated by DOM diffing, virtual DOM and state management. 
- **Vue** ðŸ’š : I use it in every single personal project. Vue for the Web and Vue + Electron for Desktop.
- **Python** ðŸ’™ : who doesn't love python?


Tools i enjoy using the most:
- Trello
- GitHub (Obviously)
- Figma
- VSCode (Not original, i know. But at least i made my own theme)

My personal interests are UI/UX Design, finance, and space exploration (looking forward to see Elon land on Mars).
