### Hi there 👋

My name is Natan and I’m a Computer Science Student and Junior Web Developer with a passion for UX.

Tech i enjoy working with the most: 
- **JavaScript** 💛 : I'm particular fascinated by DOM diffing, virtual DOM and state management. 
- **Vue** 💚 : I use it in every single personal project. Vue for the Web and Vue + Electron for Desktop.
- **Python** 💙 : who doesn't love python?


Tools I enjoy using the most:
- Trello
- GitHub (Obviously)
- Figma
- VSCode (Not original, i know. But i made my own theme)

My personal interests are UI/UX Design, finance, and space exploration (looking forward to see Elon land on Mars).
